Gemini Chat Client
A local AI client for interacting with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. It's written in pure HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Everything runs directly in your browser – no servers, no build processes, and no dependency on third-party hosting.
Features
 * Material 3 style interface
 * Light and dark theme support
 * Direct Gemini API calls (model: gemini-2.0-flash)
 * Chat history saved in localStorage
 * Quick replies and dialogue summarization
 * Code block support with "Copy" button
 * Manual API key input by the user
How to Use
 * Download the gemini-client.html file.
 * Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
 * On the first launch, you'll be prompted to enter your Gemini API key – it will be saved locally in localStorage (and only for you).
 * Chat with the AI like a cool conversational partner!
> Where to get a key?
> Go to Google AI Studio → Settings → API key.
Security
The API key is stored only in the user's browser and is not sent anywhere except in requests to the Google API. However, since this is a client-side application, it's not recommended to use sensitive or paid keys without restrictions.
